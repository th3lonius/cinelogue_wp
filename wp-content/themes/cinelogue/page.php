<p><i>"Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth"</i>—Alan Watts</p>
<br>
<p>Cinelogue is a collaborative enterprise between a diverse group of writers to critically examine film as an art and a medium. Though based in the United States, Cinelogue strives to be a place where film can be discussed independent of race, creed and national boundary, though with the understanding that all of those things color our experience as well as the films we examine. We celebrate the kaleidoscopic fancy of global cinema; we celebrate films that, regardless of their renown or lack thereof, are accomplished pieces, as Brakhage would have it, of "visual music". As a result, we tend to look at films through a decidedly auteurist lens, though we refuse to define authorship as strictly the domain of film directors, or ascribe to the medium any monolithic sense of being.</p>
<br>
<p>If we at Cinelogue share a common belief, it's that cinema is principally a sensory medium--one in which the "raw materials" of a story are not so important as their configuration--and films that we treasure are those that channel their ideas through means that are cinematic, unique to the medium. If we have a particular focus, it's on classic, foreign, independent and art house cinema, though the precise content is determined by the babel of voices of our contributors who have complete freedom to write about anything they wish.</p>

<br>
<p>As a celebration of film art, one could call Cinelogue an exercise in the art of criticism. However, we don't subscribe to (nor prescribe) any particular school. Neither do we have pretensions of authority; we don't presume that the discussion is ever final and instead encourage just that; the commenting capability exists to serve this purpose of community.</p><br>
